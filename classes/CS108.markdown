**An Introduction to Python (3 credits)**

---

\
An introduction to some of the basic issues in computation through exercises in Python programming. Students will write relatively simple programs in several application areas, e.g. mathematics, graphics and biology. This is a good course for those who have no programing experience and who want preparation for taking CS 110; students learn about using an editor, program design, implementation, and testing. This is also a good course for scientists who wish to learn a popular scientific scripting language.
