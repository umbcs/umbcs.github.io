The department offers a BS and BA in [Computer Science](https://www.umb.edu/science-mathematics/academic-departments/computer-science/) and a BS in [Information Technology](https://www.umb.edu/academics/program-finder/information-technology-bs/). Our BS program in Computer Science is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of [ABET](http://www.abet.org/). ABET assures quality for degree programs in applied science, computing, engineering, and technology. The BS program provides a rigorous education in theory and practice of Computer Science in addition to outside science courses. Our BA program provides a similar education in the theory and practice of Computer Science with more of an emphasis on outside humanities. Either degree can be used as a basis for many jobs in industry or for graduate work in Computer Science and other fields. We have an Honors Program for students who complete an Honors Thesis.

We offer the Undergraduate Certificate in Computer Science for non-degree seeking students, and for matriculated students who are majoring in other fields. We also provide a [CS105]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS105) course introducing computer literacy for non-majors.

The Undergraduate Certificate provides a fundamental core education in Computer Science that may be appropriate for students who need a Computer Science education in their career field. It may also be beneficial for students having undergraduate degrees in other fields who want to demonstrate their competency in Computer Science.

We offer a curriculum stressing software development. It provides training appropriate for students with interests in areas such as systems programming, compiler development, artificial intelligence, database management, and software engineering. An aptitude for logical reasoning and mathematics is needed to complete the major successfully, partly because designing programs to solve problems requires good problem solving skills and partly because some of the requirements are relatively advanced theoretical Computer Science and mathematics courses.

In addition to the BS in IT offered by the Computer Science Department, there are other opportunities for degrees or certificates in Information Technology within the University. The College of Advancing and Professional Studies [CAPS](http://www.umb.edu/academics/caps), offers a Certificate in [Information Technology](https://www.umb.edu/academics/program-finder/information-technology-certificate/) earned from the [College of Management](https://www.umb.edu/business/). The College of Management also provides a Masterâ€™s program in [Information Technology](https://www.umb.edu/academics/program-finder/information-technology-ms/).

**Registration**

Currently enrolled students who wish to major in Computer Science or Information Technology should file a Declaration of Major [form](https://www.umb.edu/registrar/forms/undergraduate/) with the Registrar. CS majors need to declare the BS or BA degree, while IT majors need to include the track they wish to pursue.

New students who wish to work towards a BA or BS at UMass Boston must file the appropriate application with the Admissions Office. New students, who are not seeking a degree, but wish to earn the certificate in Computer Science, or matriculated students who wish to minor in CS, must file a Certificate Program Application form with the Registrar. The form must first be signed by the department chair. New students who wish merely to take courses may enroll as non-degree students. Transfer students should contact the Undergraduate Program Director, who can answer any questions about transfer credit for Computer Science course work done at another institution.

**Degrees and Certificates**

This section describes the various undergraduate degrees that the department offers. Please note that the requirements depend on whether or not you declared your major prior to September 1, 2002. Information for the Undergraduate Certificate Program in CS can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/certificate-programs).

**No course taken to satisfy a requirement for a degree or certificate may be taken Pass/Fail.**
