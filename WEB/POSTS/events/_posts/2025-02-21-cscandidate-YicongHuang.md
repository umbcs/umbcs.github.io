<p><b>Abstract: </b> In an era where data-driven decision-making shapes industries, governments, and everyday life, the ability to leverage data science has become an essential skill. Modern data science techniques, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and large language models (LLMs), offer advanced capabilities but often require programming expertise, limiting accessibility for a broader audience.
