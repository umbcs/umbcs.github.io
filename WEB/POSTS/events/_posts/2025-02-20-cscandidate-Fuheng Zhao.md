<p><b>Abstract: </b> The exponential growth of data has introduced significant challenges for traditional query processing systems, creating a pressing need for faster and more resource-efficient approaches. Approximation techniques have emerged as a promising solution, striking an optimal balance between accuracy and performance. Data summaries, such as samples, sketches, and histograms, play a crucial role in this paradigm by condensing large datasets into compact representations and maintaining critical insights. Additionally, recent advances in generative models (including large language models) open new possibilities for handling incomplete information, accommodating diverse data types, and approximating complex computations at scale. In this talk, I will discuss my research on theoretically grounded data summarization methods, as well as my latest efforts to integrate generative models into data systems. Together, these contributions advance approximate query processing toward realistic, high-impact applications in modern data analytics.
