UMass Boston’s computer science master’s program thoroughly prepares students for a professional career in software development. This established and innovative program stresses the integration of theoretical knowledge with practical applications. Our Computer Science MS graduates are in high demand with major tech sector employers and startups. We invite you to learn more by joining <a href="https://admissions.umb.edu/graduate-students/request">our email list</a>.

**Degree Requirements**

Candidates for the degree complete a minimum of 30 credits, at least 24 of which must be in courses numbered 600 or above.

Object-Oriented Software Development I and II ([CS680]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS680) and [CS681]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS681)), including Software Development Laboratory ([CS682]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS682)) are required courses and carry a total of 9 credits. Students must take this sequence during the final part of their coursework. We also require that students choose two theoretical electives and five applied electives from among the following courses:

**Theoretical Electives:**

[CS620: Theory of Computation]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS620)

[CS622: Theory of Formal languages]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS622)

[MATH470: Mathematical Logic](https://courses.umb.edu/course_catalog/course_info/ugrd_math_all_470)

Applied Electives:

[CS612: Algorithms in Bioinformatics]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS612)

[CS642: Cybersecurity in the Internet of Things]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS642)

[CS646: Computer Communication Networks]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS646)

[CS648: Wireless Networks and Mobile Computing]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS648)

[CS651: Compilers]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS651)

[CS670: Artificial Intelligence]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS670)

[CS671: Machine Learning]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS671)

[CS675: Computer Vision]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS675)

[CS752: Parallel Programming]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS752)

These following undergraduate courses:

[CS410: Introduction to Software Engineering]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS410)

[CS411: Competitive Programming]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS411)

[CS433: Big Data Analytics]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS433)

[CS443: Mobile Applications]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS443)

[CS449: Introduction to Computer Security]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS449)

[CS450: The Structure of Higher Level Languages]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS450)

[CS460: Graphics]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS460)

[CS461: Computer Games Programming]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS461)

No more than two upper-level undergraduate courses may be used for graduate credit in the MS program. Upper-level undergraduate courses are undergraduate courses at the 400 level mentioned in one of the previous lists.  CS210L, CS240, and CS310 are general prerequisites for all graduate courses.

**Capstone Requirement**

To complete the MS program students must participate in a software development project by taking the software development sequence ([CS680]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS680), [CS681]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS681), and [CS682]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS682)). In general, this sequence is taken during the last two semesters in the MS program. The project is approved by a committee that consists of two faculty members (professors who are currently teaching the software development course and supervise the software development laboratory) and the Graduate Program Director.

In exceptional circumstances, students with significant industrial experience may request a waiver of the software development requirement by applying to a faculty committee established for this purpose. As a part of the waiver application, the student must present a portfolio demonstrating the nature of this experience. Students who receive a waiver will be required to complete an MS thesis.
