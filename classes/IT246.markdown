**Introduction to Networks (3 credits)**

---

\
We will study basic data communication and networking concepts for LAN and WAN: network protocols with emphasis on Ethernet, PPP, TCP/IP, and WWW protocols, and mobile and wireless networks. Network applications include Telnet, ftp, email, distributed file systems, and client-server applications. We survey network security issues. We will do hands-on network simulation and network sniffing exercises to see how these technologies work in practice.
