Our BS program in Computer Science is accredited by the [Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET](https://www.abet.org/). ABET assures quality for degree programs in applied science, computing, engineering, and technology. The program provides a rigorous education in theory and practice of Computer Science in addition to outside science courses. A BS degree can be used as a basis for many jobs in industry or for graduate work in Computer Science and other fields. We have an Honors Program for students who complete an Honors Thesis.

We offer a curriculum stressing software development. It provides training appropriate for students with interests in areas such as cybersecurity, data mining, artificial intelligence, database management, and software engineering. An aptitude for logical reasoning and mathematics is needed to complete the major successfully, partly because designing programs to solve problems requires good problem solving skills and partly because some of the requirements are relatively advanced theoretical Computer Science and mathematics courses.

Degree-seeking students must also satisfy the other requirements of the college such as the University Residency Requirement, [Writing Proficiency requirement](https://www.umb.edu/academics/vpass/undergraduate_studies/writing_proficiency), [Quantitative reasoning requirements](https://www.umb.edu/academics/vpass/undergraduate_studies/general_education_requirements/quantitative_reasoning), [General Distribution requirement](https://www.umb.edu/academics/vpass/undergraduate_studies/general_education_requirements/distribution_requirement), [Diversity requirement](https://www.umb.edu/academics/vpass/undergraduate_studies/general_education_requirements/diversity_requirement), Verbal Reasoning and Expression requirement, and the First-Year and Intermediate Seminars requirement. These are not listed here.

**Objectives**

Within three to five years of graduation, graduates of the BS in Computer Science Program at UMass Boston will achieve the following:

 1.	Our graduates will obtain rewarding employment in industry or graduate programs in computer science using the technical skills and knowledge that they acquired during their studies.
 
 2. Our graduates will be informed and active members of their communities and be thoughtful CS professionals based on their awareness of the human and social issues in computer science.

 3. During their professional careers, our graduates will use and further develop appropriate organizational, communicative, and teamwork skills.

 4. Our graduates will maintain intellectual curiosity and stay informed and knowledgeable about current trends and technologies in their field.

**Student Outcomes**

Graduates of the program will have the ability to:   

1.    Analyze a complex computing problem and apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.  

2.    Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline. 

3.    Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts.  

4.    Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles.  

5.    Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program’s discipline. 

6.    Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions. 

**Major Change Starting Spring 2023**

Following a recent ABET accreditation review, we have changed our BS program to accommodate their new criteria. CS450 and the science elective are no longer required, although CS450 can still be taken as an elective. CS446 and CS449 are required. The change applies to students who declared a CS/BS major in or after Spring 2023.

**Sample Program for the Major (for students who declared a CS major before Spring 2023)**

We present below a possible sequence of Mathematics and Computer Science courses leading to satisfaction of the department requirements in four years. We do not show courses in other departments.

This schedule is only an example; not a prescription or a recommendation. Programs of study will vary depending on students’ interests and abilities. Stronger students may wish to do more than meet the minimal requirements.
