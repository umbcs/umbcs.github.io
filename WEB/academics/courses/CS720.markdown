Topics include the syntax and semantics of predicate logic, formal systems for predicate logic, many-sorted logic, and logic programming. Additional topics may include equational logic, algebraic specification, term rewriting, program verification, nonstandard logic, and databases. Students are expected to demonstrate an understanding of theoretical material and the ability to apply it.
