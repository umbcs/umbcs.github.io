## Certificate Undergraduate Program

Students whose preparation in Computer Science is insufficient for admission to the Master’s program should consider seeking the Undergraduate Certificate. The Undergraduate Certificate is also intended for students who are mainly interested in computer applications, or in a certificate program instead of receiving a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. If the student is already matriculated at UMass Boston. Because of the prerequisite structure of the courses it may take two years to complete the Certificate (the exact time will of course depend on the student’s background), and it may not be possible to do course work full-time. In particular, the listed mathematics requirements begin with calculus. However, many students may need a review of high school algebra. On the other hand, students who enter this program with previous mathematics or computer programming experience will be given appropriate credit.

Since non-matriculated students in the Certificate programs are considered non-degree students one needs to register for classes with the [Non-degree Registration form](https://www.cct.umb.edu/NonDegreeRego.pdf) at [One-Stop](https://www.umb.edu/onestop). A non-matriculated Certificate program student does not apply to UMass Boston for admission. All students who wish to start the Certificate Program should file a [Undergraduate Certificate Program Application](https://www.umb.edu/media/umassboston/content-assets/documents/pdfs/UndergradCertificateProgramApplication_Sp20_v1.pdf) which can be obtained from the Registrar’s Office or their website and requires the signature of the [department chair](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~marc/) or [Undergraduate Computer Science Director, Nurit Haspel](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~nurith/). Once the form has been signed, return the form to [One Stop](https://www.umb.edu/onestop) in the Campus Center, or to the [Registrar’s ](https://www.umb.edu/registrar).

**Certificate in Computer Science Requirements:**

- [CS110]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS110), [CS210]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS210), [Math140](https://www.umb.edu/course_catalog/course_info/ugrd_MATH_all_140), [CS220]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS220), [CS240]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS240), [CS310]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS310)
- [CS341]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS341) or Computer Science elective
- One application elective
- A minimum 2.0 GPA of the courses for the CS certificate is required

The Computer Science Department does not offer winter courses; we only offer classes during Fall, Spring, and Summer semesters. We currently do not offer online courses. The Undergraduate Certificate typically requires 4 semesters due to prerequisites. We do not allow students to take requisites out of order. The schedule is as follows:

1st semester –[CS110]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS110) and [Math140](https://www.umb.edu/course_catalog/course_info/ugrd_MATH_all_140)

2nd semester-[CS210]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS210), [CS220]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS220) and [CS240]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS240)

3rd semester-[CS310]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS310) and [CS341]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS341) (or CS elective)

4th semester – (\*Application Elective)

**Application elective**: The applications requirement may be satisfied by any Computer Science course numbered higher than CS341, or by a course taught outside of the department of Computer Science in computer applications to another discipline. Students wishing to use such a course as the applications elective for a Certificate must have their choice approved in advance by the Undergraduate Program Director and must meet the prerequisites for the course set by the department in which it is offered.

Interested students who would like to speak to an advisor about our Undergraduate Certificate should contact the CS Undergraduate Program Director, [Nurit Haspel](mailto:nurit.haspel@umb.edu).

## Certificate Graduate

**Database Technology Certificate Program**

The Graduate Certificate Program in Database Technology provides students with a systematic education in databases, stressing database application development and database administration skills.

The decision to institute this program was made upon our assessment of a strong need for database training. From application development to database administration, there are many positions available in the industry a student may choose to pursue. There is also the need for professionals with formal training in contemporary tools; the database program offers such individuals an opportunity to strengthen this knowledge base.

Proficiency in programming will be expected (including Java and C). The entire program is offered in the extended day, so the students can attend while holding a full-time position in industry.

The certificate requires 12 credit hours (4 courses). The basic training consists of a sequence of three courses: [CS630]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS630) (Database Management Systems), [CS615]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS615) (User Interface Design), and [CS634]({{site.baseurl}}/academics/courses/CS634) (Architecture of Database Systems). These courses provide a thorough introduction to relational and object-relational databases, SQL, indexing, concurrency and recovery, and design of user interfaces for database applications.

For information regarding the Graduate Certificate, including fees and registration, please visit the webpage for the [College of Advancing and Professional Studies](https://www.umb.edu/academics/caps).

Faculty teaching in the graduate certificate program consists of the following:

[Dan Simovici](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~dsim/), Professor and Program Director: Database management Systems, Data Mining

[Wei Ding](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~ding/), Associate Professor: Database-Backed Web Sites and Web Services

[Gabriel Ghinita](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~gghinita/), Associate Professor: Database Management Systems, Database Security
